👋 Hi, I’m Basit Ali

👀 I’m passionate about coding, especially in web development, and love exploring new technologies in the tech field.

🌱 I completed my MERN stack journey with NetBots a few months ago, where I built a full-stack shoe project. Since then, I have been refining my skills by working on frontend projects, creating web clones, and diving deep into Next.js to enhance my expertise as a full-stack developer.

💼 Currently, I am an intern at NetBots, working on a dashboard project while also exploring UI design, TypeScript, and advanced Tailwind CSS to improve my frontend development skills.

💞️ My tech stack includes React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQLite (Prisma). I'm always working on new projects to strengthen my problem-solving and design skills.
